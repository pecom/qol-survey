# Stony Brook University Physics Department: Student "Quality of Life" Survey Analysis

In March and April of 2024, the Physics Grad Student Association (PGSA) of Stony Brook University (SBU) surveyed the graduate students in the physics and astronomy department. The survey covered topics including students' happiness, finances, work-life balance, and experience with program requirements. 102 students responded to the survey. Although the raw responses are kept confidential, we here share analyses and graphs of the aggregate data received.

## Analyses

Each Jupyter notebook contains analysis contributed by a different student. Credit goes to Edoardo for the first pass at analysis, including the setup code with pandas dataframes that each notebook begins with.

Edoardo's analysis is comprehensive. It includes extensive bar graphs on student learning from the comprehensive exams, breakdown of most questions by research group, and correlations between all variables.

Prak's analysis explores in depth the effects of demographic on happiness and belonging. It includes heatmaps and violin plots for distributions. This analysis is the most statistically robust and most thoughtfully discussed in the notebook. It is also notable for some pretty comp exams plots and for the distribution of pay in context of the living wage in Long Island.

Melissa's analysis notably includes ranking of research groups by mental and physical health, calculations of the yearly cost of holding comps, and investigation of students' feelings of preparedness coming into the program.
